2016 Rio Olympics Website Design Concepts

The website will be based on a number of frontend and
backend technologies.
First of all, a server-side backend must be built.
It will will most likely cosist of an apache2 or nginx
web server with a (hopefully) custom built admin panel
tools for managing content. The panel will need a
database (mysql) server and an ftp server to function
successfully. Possible choice of technologies includes
JSP, ASP, PHP, Cold Fusion, CGI.
The client side will use multiple technologies
available includeing JavaScript, VBScript /Jscript,
dynamic HTML, JQuery, PHP, Python.
The website will be based on templates which will be
able to have information plugged into them from the
ftp and database part of backend. The frontend will be
written in HTML/XHTML/XML/CSS combo with heavy
javascript usage in order to allow advanced visual design capabilities.
The top of the website will have a tab style layout
for a quick reference to any part of the available
information of the website.The Design will be tile
based where tiles will alternate beteen heading style
and tiles with details about competitions etc.
Forms will be available thorughout the design for
client convenience of narowing down the information
based on their interest.
On top of the clientside side there needs to be a
mobile frontend aimed at small screens.
